                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Single-cell foundation models like Tahoe-x1 have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding cellular biology, but their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. At Lucent Cell, we applied sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose the Tahoe model's learned representations into interpretable features that correspond to meaningful biological concepts.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>
                        We trained TopK sparse autoencoders on intermediate layer activations from the Tahoe-x1 model using the SAELens framework. Our approach involved several key steps:
                    </p>

                    <h3>Model Setup</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Foundation Model:</strong> Tahoe-x1 70M parameter model from HuggingFace</li>
                        <li><strong>Hook Points:</strong> Extracted activations from MLP outputs at layers 0, 3, 6, 9, and 11</li>
                        <li><strong>SAE Architecture:</strong> TopK SAE with k=64 active features and d_sae=16,384 total features</li>
                        <li><strong>Training Data:</strong> PBMC 3k dataset with 2,700 cells and 32,738 genes</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Training Process</h3>
                    <div class="code-block">
                        <pre><code># SAE Training Configuration
config = TopKTrainingSAEConfig(
    d_in=512,           # Tahoe hidden dimension
    d_sae=16384,        # SAE feature dimension
    k=64,               # Top-k sparsity
    learning_rate=3e-4,
    batch_size=4096
)

# Extract activations and train SAE
activations = extract_tahoe_activations(model, dataloader, layer=6)
sae = train_sparse_autoencoder(activations, config, steps=10000)
</code></pre>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>

                    <h3>1. Cell Type-Specific Features</h3>
                    <p>
                        Several SAE features showed strong correspondence to known cell types. Feature 1247 activated specifically for T cells, with top-associated genes including CD3D, CD3G, and IL7R. Feature 892 was selective for monocytes, associating with CD14, FCGR3A, and S100A8.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Biological Pathway Encoding</h3>
                    <p>
                        Feature 2156 captured interferon response pathways, with strong associations to ISG15, IFIT1, and MX1. This suggests the model learns to represent coordinated gene expression programs that are fundamental to cellular function.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Disease-Associated Features</h3>
                    <p>
                        Remarkably, Feature 7834 showed enrichment for genes associated with inflammatory diseases through our validation against the Open Targets database, including TNF, IL1B, and CXCL8. This demonstrates the model's ability to encode disease-relevant biological patterns.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Validation Results</h2>
                    <p>
                        We validated our extracted features against multiple biological databases:

                    <h2>Implications for Research</h2>

                    <h3>Understanding Model Behavior</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our SAE analysis reveals that Tahoe-x1 learns biologically meaningful representations without explicit supervision. The model naturally organizes its internal features around cell types, pathways, and disease states that are fundamental to cellular biology.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Drug Discovery Applications</h3>
                    <p>
                        The interpretable features we extracted could guide drug target identification. Features that activate in disease-associated cellular states may reveal novel therapeutic targets or biomarkers for precision medicine approaches.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Model Improvement</h3>
                    <p>
                        Understanding which biological concepts the model captures (and which it misses) can inform training strategies for next-generation foundation models. Features with poor biological validation highlight areas where model architecture or training data could be improved.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our complete pipeline is available as an open-source Python package that integrates with the Tahoe ecosystem. Key components include:
                    </p>

                    <h2>Future Directions</h2>

                        This work opens several promising research directions:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Feature Steering:</strong> Manipulating SAE features to control model predictions</li>
                        <li><strong>Cross-Model Analysis:</strong> Comparing features across different foundation models</li>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our sparse autoencoder analysis demonstrates that single-cell foundation models like Tahoe-x1 learn rich, interpretable representations of cellular biology. By making these representations transparent, we can better understand model behavior, validate biological insights, and guide the development of more effective AI systems for biological research.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This work represents a crucial step toward trustworthy AI in biology, where model predictions are not just accurate but also interpretable and actionable. As foundation models become increasingly powerful, mechanistic interpretability will be essential for translating their capabilities into real-world therapeutic advances.
